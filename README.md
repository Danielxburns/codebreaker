# Codebreaker (AKA Mastermind)



## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 8 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
```
## Installation

from the root folder of the project enter your terminal and type:

```npm install```
```npx expo start```

a QR code will show up in your terminal. You will need this for the next step.

## Running your React Native application

Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.  
  - On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.  
  - On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.  

## Roadmap

React Native defaults new applications to TypeScript, but JavaScript may still be used.  
With this in mind, I have decided to learn Typescript before proceeding.
