## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 8 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
```
## Installation

Navigate to the the root folder of the project  
In your terminal enter:

```
$ npm install  
```

When it's done installing enter

```
$ npx expo start
```

a QR code will show up in your terminal. You will need this for the next step.

## Running your React Native application

Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.  
  - On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.  
  - On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.

React Native defaults new applications to TypeScript (but JavaScript may still be used).  

With this in mind, learning more about React Native without first learning Typescript didn't seem like the wisest path to take. I have decided to learn Typescript before proceeding.

As of 05/01/23 the app looks like this:
